# LeanTimeReporting
**Overview**

Lean Time Reporting (LTR) is a streamlined approach for Agile teams to track time, replacing traditional time tracking tools and processes.

**Introduction**

Traditional time tracking requires users to enter the number of hours spent on different tasks, projects, and clients. To be accurate, the timesheets need to be completed at least once a week, or even every day to ensure good accuracy. Indeed, studies are showing that reporting time at the end of the month decreases the accuracy to 40% according to the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. The issue is that time tracking is often perceived as time consuming, nonvalue added, and too granular. It is thus not the priority of users. Furthermore, some users might be required to track their activities in a different system than their day-to-day Application Lifecycle Management tool. 

The goal of the Lean Time Reporting is to prevent manual entries per tasks on a timesheet (most common method), usage of timer to clock time while working on tasks, or calculation of the elapsed time spent in one status per assignee and per task. The last two methods require up -front assignment of the tasks and continuous updates of these assignments in case of priorities or availability changes.

Lean Time Reporting not only allows users to focus on the execution of their tasks and transfer the management of the reporting of time spent to the Release Train Engineers (SAFe Methodology), but also allows to report time at a granular level (up to the user story) without complexifying the process. This prevents some projects/teams from compromising the granularity of information collected to ensure accurate time spent. Furthermore, as Lean Time Reporting requires strong Agile practices, it pushes the team towards continuous improvement, it is an incentive to adopt the agile mindset.

| WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) |SAP WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) refers to the model of the project that organizes project tasks into a priority list and outlines a hierarchical list for each task. An individual WBS element represents specific activities within the overall work breakdown structure.|
|Team dedication |The Team Dedication reflects how much time and effort a team member devotes to the goals and deliverables of the team. In our system it is a percentage. Someone who has no work to be done outside his/her team is fully dedicated to the team (100% of dedication) |
